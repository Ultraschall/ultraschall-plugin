# Installation instructions for Ultraschall 5

The Ultraschall open-source project is an extension for the commercially available REAPER audio production software.

The test version of REAPER is _fully functional for 60 days_ and costs US$ 60 afterwards.

The Ultraschall installation comprises **two mandatory steps (Windows: three)**.

---

## macOS 10.11 or above

## 1.

## Update / Install REAPER

Ultraschall 5 is only compatible to REAPER version 6.25. Since version 6, a special Catalina+ version has been offered for REAPER, which contains additional licenses. Furthermore there is a highly optimized version for Apple Silicon M1 computers (ARM). It is essential to choose the appropriate version:

[**Download REAPER Version v6.25 OS X 64-bit**](https://www.reaper.fm/files/6.x/reaper625_x86_64.dmg)

[**Download REAPER Version v6.25 OS X 64-bit Catalina/Big Sur**](https://www.reaper.fm/files/6.x/reaper625_x86_64_catalina.dmg)

[**Download REAPER Version v6.25 OS X 64-bit ARM Apple Silicon**](https://www.reaper.fm/files/6.x/reaper625-beta_arm64.dmg)


* Download and open the `.dmg`, and install REAPER or update to version 6.25 respectively.
* Using any other REAPER version will lead to the Ultraschall plugin being deactivated and not being launched. We strongly advise you NOT to update REAPER manually to any other version than 6.25.

## 2.

## Download Ultraschall and launch the Ultraschall installer

Download our Ultraschall 5 distribution and open the `.dmg` file:

[**Download Ultraschall 5**](http://url.ultraschall-podcast.de/us5mac)

* In the new window, run and complete the `Ultraschall-5.0.pkg` installation program.
* **Caution:** Should you experience an error message at the end of the installation routine, please restart macOS and run the Installer again.
* Then launch the REAPER app from the Program directory - Ulraschall 5 will start.

---

## Verify Success of the Installation

* Should you experience error messages please verify that you have REAPER version 6.25 installed (step 1). If in doubt, re-install REAPER.
* It may also help to restart your computer and run the `First Aid` option in the macOS Disk Utility application.
* In case of persisting issues or when you want to update an outdated version of Ultraschall prior to 3.0 we recommend to run the scripts `Uninstall.command` and `Remove legacy audio devices.commend` provided in the .dmg and subsequently restart your computer. After restart please repeat steps 1 to 3.
  Should _any of these measures_ fail, you can ask for help in our user forum: [Ultraschall at Sendegate](https://sendegate.de/c/ultraschall)
* We recommend you watch the release screencast in our [Tutorials area](http://ultraschall.fm/tutorials/) to find out about the new features.

## Optional - Install UltraschallHub

In case you want to use purely software-defined N-1 audio-routing for Skype recording, installing our proprietary UltraschallHub audio devices is a prerequisite.

* Run `UltraschallHub.pkg` from the `.dmg` window.
* Restart your computer. The new audio devices should now be present in the macOS Audio MIDI Setup.
  This step is _not required_ for using StudioLink, StudioLink OnAir or the Ultraschall Soundboard.
